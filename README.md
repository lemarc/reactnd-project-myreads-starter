# MyReads
This is the MyReads project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It is a simple react app that displays 3 bookshelves with the ability to move books between shelves. There is also a search page for adding new books to the shelves. Forked from the the starter template provided by Udacity.

## Installation
Download/clone the project and in the project directory install dependencies with
`npm -install`

## Usage
After installation run the project with
`npm -start`
The react app will open at http://localhost:3000/

## Contributing

This project was done as a means to learn the basics of react. If you want practice with react I would recommend forking the starter project at https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.
